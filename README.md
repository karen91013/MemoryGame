# MemoryGame
Created a game where players have to flip over cards to locate the pairs that match. 

How the game works:
Gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:
The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
